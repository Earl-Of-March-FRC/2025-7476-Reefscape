# Test Procedures

This directory contains repeatable test procedures for validating robot subsystems.

## Vision Tests

- [**Pose Accuracy Test**](vision/pose-accuracy-test.md) - Validate PhotonVision pose estimation accuracy against ground truth measurements

## Purpose

Test procedures are designed to:
- Be repeatable across practice sessions
- Provide clear pass/fail criteria
- Generate data for tuning and validation
- Document baseline performance for comparison

## Guidelines

- Test specs define the procedure (what to do)
- Results should be recorded in dated files (e.g., `results-2025-01-18.md`)
- Link test results in engineering notebook entries for full context
- Update procedures based on learnings from test runs
